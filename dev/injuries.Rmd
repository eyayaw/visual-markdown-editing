## Case study: ER injuries {#er-injuries .case-study style="margin-top: 25px;"}

### The data

We're going to explore data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), collected by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This is a long-term study that records all accidents seen in a representative sample of hospitals in the United States.

It's an interesting dataset to explore because every one is already familiar with the domain, and each observation is accompanied by a short narrative that explains how the accident occurred. You can find out more about this dataset at <https://github.com/hadley/neiss>.
