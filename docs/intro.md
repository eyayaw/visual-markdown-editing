<h1>Visual R Markdown</h1>

RStudio v1.4 includes an experimental visual markdown editing mode. Highlights of visual mode include:

-   Visual editing for all of Pandoc markdown, including tables, footnotes, citations, divs/spans, definition lists, id/class attributes, equations, TeX, and HTML.

-   Markdown expressions (e.g. `##`, `**bold**`, etc.) can be used within the visual editor for formatting.

-   Tight integration with source editing (editing location and undo/redo state are preserved when switching between modes).

?\> Visual mode does not yet incorporate R code editing intelligence (e.g. code completion, auto-indent, keyboard shortcuts etc.) or inline chunk output. As a result, it is currently aimed at composition of longer-form documents rather than interactive data analysis. Additional code editing and execution features will be added in subsequent releases.

## Getting Started

Visual markdown editing is currently only available in the [daily build](https://dailies.rstudio.com) of RStudio. You can download the desktop version of the daily build here:

[downloads](_download.md ":include")

For other desktop platforms or RStudio Server, please visit <https://dailies.rstudio.com>.

?\> Daily builds are intended for testing purposes, and are not recommended for general use.

### Enabling Visual Mode

Visual markdown editing is not available by default. To enable it, use **Preferences -\> R Markdown**:

Once you've enabled visual editing, you can switch between source and visual mode using the button at the top-right of the document toolbar (you can also switch using the <kbd>⌃⇧ F8</kbd> keyboard shortcut):
