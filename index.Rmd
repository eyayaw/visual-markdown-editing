## Overview

RStudio v1.4 includes an experimental visual markdown editing mode. Users of R Markdown that write longer-form documents often use tools like Typora (or even Google Docs) for composition. Visual editing mode provides an alternative that is seamlessly integrated with RStudio. Features of visual mode include:

-   Support for all of Pandoc markdown, including tables, footnotes, citations, divs/spans, defintiton lists, id/class attributes, LaTeX math, and inilne TeX/HTML.

-   Markdown expressions (e.g. `##`, `**bold**,` etc.) can be used within the visual editor for formatting.

-   Tight integration with source editing (when you switch between modes your editing location is preserved).

Visual mode is currently only useful for composition (code chunks are not executable). We plan on adding support for code execution in future versions of RStudio.

## Getting Started

Visual markdown editing is currently only available in the daily build of RStudio v1.4. You can download the most recent daily build here: <https://dailies.rstudio.com>.

Visual markdown editing is not available by default. To enable it, use the **R Markdown** tab of RStudio Preferences:

![](images/visual-editing-pref.png){style="border: 1px solid rgb(230, 230, 230)" width="588"}

Once you've enabled visual editing, you can switch between source and visual mode using the button at the top-right of the document toolbar:

![](images/visual-editing-toggle.png){width="700"}

Once you've done this, the editor will switch to visual mode and an editing toolbar with various formatting commands will appear. There is also a keyboard shortcut (**Ctrl+Shift+F8**) that can be used to switch modes.

## Editing Commands

Visual editing mode includes conventional word-processor style gestures for headings, formatting, etc. on the editing toolbar:

![](images/visual-editing-toolbar.png){width="700"}

In addition to using the editing toolbar, you can also use markdown syntax directly. When the editor sees markdown shortcuts it automatically applies the associated formatting. Note that if you didn't intend this, you can use backspace to revert the applied formatting.

### Shortcuts

There are also keyboard shortcuts available for several commands. Here are the keyboard and markdown shortcuts currently supported (note that you should substitute Cmd for Ctrl on Mac systems):

| Formatting       | Keyboard Shortcut | Markdown Shortcut                                          |

### Typography

Most markdown formats support smart typography, which causes straight quotes to be interpreted as curly quotes, -- as en-dashes, --- as em-dashes, and ... as ellipses. Visual mode supports these same transformations (so when you type --- it becomes an em-dash). If you didn't intend for this transformation to occur just hit backspace and it will be reverted.

## Citations & Footnotes

You can include citations using the standard Pandoc syntax for citations:

![](images/visual-editing-citations.png){width="700"}

You can include footnotes using the **Insert -\> Footnote** command. Footnote editing occurs in a pane immediately below the main document:

![](images/visual-editing.png){width="700"}

## TeX Math & Commands

TeX math is authored using standard Pandoc markdown syntax (the editor will automatically recognize the syntax and create the appropriate constructs). For example, here's some inline and display math:

![](images/visual-editing-math.png){width="700"}

You can include raw TeX commands when authoring in visual mode. The raw markup will be automatically recognized and syntax highlighted For example:

![](images/visual-editing-raw.png){width="700"}

You can also include inline and block raw content of any output format supported by Pandoc (e.g. html, rtf or openxml) using the commands on the **Format -\> Raw** menu

## Document Navigation

### Editor Outline

The editor outline enables you to quickly navigate between sections of larger documents. An outline item is included for each heading within the document. You can make the outline visible using the outline button next to the visual mode button:

![](images/visual-editing-outline.png){width="700"}

### Find/Replace

You can find and replace text within visual mode using the Find button located at the far right of the visual editing toolbar:

![](images/visual-editing-find.png){width="700"}

Note that Find/Replace will only locate matches within normal text (code blocks are not searched).

### Display Options

Visual mode uses a content width and font size generally comfortable for writing (similar to that of Google Docs). You can adjust the maximum content width (by default it's 700 pixels) as well as the font size (by default the same as the IDE) within the **R Markdown -\> Advanced** preferences.

## Markdown Formats

Visual editing mode generates markdown using Pandoc. This means that in some cases your markdown will be *rewritten* to conform to standard Pandoc idioms. For example, Pandoc writes 3 spaces after list bullets, and automatically escapes characters that might be used for markdown syntax.

While this might be bothersome at first, if you decide that visual editing mode is useful for your workflow it's probably best to just adapt to writing your own markdown the same way that Pandoc does. If any of Pandoc's idioms are particularly troublesome, [let us know](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/new) and we'll see if we can add an option to override the default behavior.

### Modes & Extensions

Visual editing mode can author all of the markdown variants supported by Pandoc. By default, features associated with standard Pandoc markdown are enabled. You can change this behavior by including an Emacs-style magic comment in your markdown document. For example, to specify that you'd like to create GitHub Flavored Markdown (Pandoc's "gfm" variant), add this comment:

    <!-- -*- mode: gfm -*- --> 

Add the comment while in source mode (it will be hidden while editing in visual mode). Note that for R Markdown (Rmd) files this comment should be located immediately after the YAML metadata block at the top of the document.

Markdown variants supported by the editor include `markdown`, `markdown_strict`, `markdown_phpextra`, `gfm`, `commonmark`, and `blackfriday`.

You can also specify that particular extensions be enabled or disabled. For example, to specify GitHub Flavored Markdown with additional support for TeX math and raw Tex, you would use this comment:

    <!-- -*- mode: gfm; extensions: +tex_math_dollars+raw_tex -*- --> 

Alternatively, to specify standard Pandoc markdown *without* TeX math and raw TeX, you would use this comment (note the minus sign before the disabled extensions):

    <!-- -*- mode: markdown; extensions: -tex_math_dollars-raw_tex -*- --> 

You can read more about Pandoc variants and extensions in the [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) documentation.

### Document Types

The R Markdown ecosystem has a wide variety of document formats, most of which rely on the core set of Pandoc markdown extensions. However, there are a number of formats that include additional markdown extensions (for example, the cross-reference extension introduced by the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) package is also supported by the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [distll](https://rstudio.github.io/distill) packages).

RStudio can generally detect which type of document is being edited and enable the requisite extensions. In the case that this doesn't work as expected, you can specify a `doctype` in the format comment to make it explicit. For example:

    <!-- -*- doctype: blogdown -*- -->

Available doctypes include `xref`, `bookdown`, `blogdown`, and `hugo` (you can specify more than one doctype by separating them with commas). The `xref` doctype specifies any document that supports bookdown cross-references (e.g. distill) and is implied by the `bookdown` and `blogdown` doctypes. The `hugo` doctype indicates a document that supports Hugo shortcodes, and is also implied by the `blogdown` doctype.

### Line Wrapping

By default, the visual editor writes Markdown with no line wrapping (paragraphs all occupy a single line). This matches the behavior of markdown source editing mode within RStudio.

If however you prefer to have paragraphs wrapped at a particular column (e.g. 72 or 80). You can set an option to this effect within the **R Markdown** preferences pane where visual mode is enabled. You can also set this behavior on a per-document basis by including a `fill-column` variable within an Emacs-style magic comment. For example:

    <!-- -*- mode: markdown; fill-column: 72 -*- --> 

Note that there are some disadvantages to setting a `fill-column.` First, editing paragraphs in source mode will be less convenient (because line wrapping will need to done manually). Second, tables with many explicitly sized columns (more than 10 or so) may be written by Pandoc as HTML rather than markdown.

## Known Limitations

There are a handful of Pandoc markdown extensions not currently supported by visual editing. These are infrequently used extensions so in all likelihood won't affect documents you edit, but are still worth noting.

| Extension            | Example             | Behavior                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Inline footnotes     | \^[inline footnote] | Converted to numeric footnote.           |
| Footnote identifiers | [\^longnote]        | Converted to numeric footnote.           |
| Example lists        | (@) First example   | Read/written as ordinary numbered lists. |
| Auto-list numbers    | #\. First item      | Read/written as ordinary numbered lists. |
| Reference links      | This is a [link]    | Converted to ordinary links.             |
| Pandoc title block   | \% My Title         | Ignored (and dropped from document).     |

In addition, the various MultiMarkdown extensions to Pandoc are not supported (note that these extensions are disabled by default in Pandoc markdown). MultiMarkdown title blocks are ignored and dropped, and MultiMarkdown link attributes and header identifiers are read and converted to Pandoc markdown equivalents.
